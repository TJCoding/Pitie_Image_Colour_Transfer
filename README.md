# Pitie_Image_Colour_Transfer
An Implementation of Pitie's Colour Transfer Method based upon a Linear Monge-Kantorovich solution.



Reference   
*Pitie F and A. Kokaram. "The linear Mange-Kantovitch linear colour mapping for example-based colour transfer."
In 4th IEE European Conference on Visual Media Production (CVMP07) London November 2007.*

This is a C++/OpenCV implementation of the processing that was first presented as a Matlab implementation here.  
https://github.com/frcs/colour-transfer.

It provides results which are comparable to, if not superior to, those provided by the 'Ruggedised Xiao' method.
